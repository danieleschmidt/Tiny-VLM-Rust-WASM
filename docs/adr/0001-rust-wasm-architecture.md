# ADR-0001: Rust + WebAssembly Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to implement a Vision-Language Model that can run efficiently on mobile devices with sub-200ms inference times. Key requirements:
- Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Web)
- Near-native performance on mobile hardware
- Small binary size for web deployment
- Memory safety and security

## Decision
Use Rust as the core implementation language, compiling to WebAssembly for web deployment and native binaries for mobile platforms.

**Architecture Components:**
- Core logic in Rust with SIMD optimizations
- WASM compilation target for web browsers
- Native compilation for iOS/Android when needed
- Hand-tuned SIMD kernels for ARM NEON and x86 AVX2

## Consequences

### Positive
- Memory safety through Rust's ownership model
- Zero-cost abstractions maintain performance
- Single codebase for multiple deployment targets
- WebAssembly provides sandboxed execution environment
- SIMD intrinsics available for both native and WASM targets
- Strong typing system prevents runtime errors

### Negative
- Larger learning curve for developers unfamiliar with Rust
- WASM has some performance overhead compared to native
- Limited debugging tools for WASM in some browsers
- Compilation times longer than interpreted languages

### Neutral
- Binary size comparable to other compiled languages
- Ecosystem maturity sufficient for ML workloads

## Implementation
1. Structure project with `lib.rs` containing core algorithms
2. Use `wasm-bindgen` for JavaScript interop
3. Feature flags to enable/disable SIMD based on target
4. Conditional compilation for platform-specific optimizations
5. Memory pool implementation to minimize allocations
