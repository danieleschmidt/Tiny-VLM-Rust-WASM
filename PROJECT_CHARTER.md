# Tiny-VLM-Rust-WASM Project Charter

## Project Vision
Create the fastest, most efficient Vision-Language Model implementation for mobile deployment, achieving sub-200ms inference through Rust optimization and WebAssembly compilation.

## Problem Statement
Current VLM implementations are too slow and resource-intensive for real-time mobile applications. Existing solutions:
- Require cloud connectivity for acceptable performance
- Consume excessive battery and memory on mobile devices  
- Lack cross-platform compatibility
- Have large deployment footprints (>500MB)

## Solution Overview
Tiny-VLM-Rust-WASM provides a pure Rust implementation of Apple's FastVLM architecture, optimized with SIMD intrinsics and compiled to WebAssembly for universal deployment.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Core VLM Implementation**: Vision encoder, text processing, multimodal fusion
- **SIMD Optimization**: ARM NEON and x86 AVX2 hand-tuned kernels
- **WebAssembly Compilation**: Browser-compatible deployment target
- **Mobile Integration**: iOS framework and Android library generation
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory pooling, quantization, caching
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for integration and deployment

### Out of Scope
- **Training Infrastructure**: Focus on inference optimization only
- **Custom Model Architectures**: Implement FastVLM specification only
- **Cloud Services**: Emphasis on edge/client-side deployment
- **GUI Applications**: Provide library/SDK, not end-user applications

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Performance**: Achieve < 200ms inference on iPhone 17 Neural Engine
2. **Size**: Deploy with < 5MB WASM binary + < 50MB model weights
3. **Compatibility**: Support iOS 15+, Android API 24+, modern browsers
4. **Accuracy**: Maintain > 70% accuracy on standard VQA benchmarks

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Developer Experience**: Comprehensive documentation and examples
2. **Community**: Active open-source community with regular contributions
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime in production deployments
4. **Security**: Pass security audit with zero critical vulnerabilities
